          Ideally we will always want to have a "master merchant" business model where
          Vexora will act as a single merchant to local provider and our merchants will
          connect via us.

          Any agreement and settlement arrangement is directly between Vexora and Local

            <li>
              Vexora will have its own agreement and settlement arrangement with our
              merchants

            <li>
              Any communication between our merchants and Local Partner should go through
              Vexora

          Local Partner give us the "buy rate” and we will add on our margin and offer the
          "sell rate” to our merchants.

            <li>Example: X% (buy rate)+ Y% (margin)= z% (sell rate)</li>
